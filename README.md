Inference.AI: Medical Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Developed as a capstone project for the SEN411 Artificial Intelligence course, Inference.AI is a dual-purpose medical tool designed to streamline clinical workflows. Its primary function is to serve as an efficient interface for recording patient diagnoses and medical history. acting as a safeguard, the system utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process this input and provide an instant, evidence-based "second opinion," helping clinicians validate their decisions and ensuring higher diagnostic accuracy.
